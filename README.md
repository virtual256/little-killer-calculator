# Little Killer Calculator
## A project by @virtual256

## What is it?
Variant sudoku calculator intended for use with Killer and Little Killer sudoku, among others.

## Why?
To assist in solving variant sudoku puzzles, killer cage total calculators are used.  Several of them exist, though all of them share a limitation - Digits may not repeat in a cage.  This restriction makes them significantly less helpful when trying to figure out if two or more cages are forced to have some particular total, or in the case of Little Killer sudokus, what a particular diagonal can entail.
